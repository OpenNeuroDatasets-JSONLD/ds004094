# Tesser

The Tesser study was designed to examine how temporal statistical learning affects reasoning about non-temporal features.

## Experiment

Participants were exposed to sequences of objects that followed a temporal community structure. They then completed three tasks that tested how temporal statistical learning affected inductive inference about object properties, event segmentation, and perceived object similarity.

Task phases:
* learn - Initial exposure to structured object sequences that were determined based on the temporal community structure.
* struct - During fMRI scanning, further viewing of structured object sequences, with interleaved scrambled object sequences.
* induct - Outside the scanner, a test of inductive inference about object properties.
* parse - Viewing of object sequences with button presses to indicate perceived event boundaries.
* group - Placement of objects on a grid based on subjective non-perceptual similarity.
